# Audio Checker Docker

## Introduction

Audio Checker Docker is a backend application designed to act as an event listener. This project is intended to be used with Momenta-AVS to retrieve audio files from the provided UI, and forward them to the inference docker. This application is built with a Flask backend.

## Features

- **Audio File Monitoring**: Polls for new audio files in a queue
- **Automatic Processing**: Downloads and forwards audio files to inference service
- **Result Tracking**: Maintains record of processed files to prevent duplication
- **Result Forwarding**: Sends inference results back to the original uploader service
- **Containerized Setup**: Easy deployment using Docker

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python (v3.8 or later)
- pip (Python package manager)
- Docker (for containerized setup)
- Docker Compose (for multi-container setup)

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/momenta-inference-docker.git
```

#### Run Docker
```bash
docker built -t audio-checker-docker .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 audio-checker-docker
```

## Usage

### Process Audio Files

- The service exposes a `/process-audio` endpoint that can be triggered to check for new audio files
- When triggered, it will:
  1. Check for new audio files in the queue
  2. Download each file
  3. Send it to the inference service
  4. Forward the results back to the original uploader
  5. Track processed files to avoid duplication

### Environment Variables

The application can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `AUDIO_LIST_URL`: URL to check for new audio files (default: `http://localhost:3001/queue`)
- `INFERENCE_URL`: URL for the inference container's endpoint (default: `http://localhost:5000/infer`)
- `RESULT_URL`: URL to send inference results (default: `http://localhost:3001/inference-result`)
- `DOWNLOAD_DIR`: Directory where downloaded audio files are stored (default: `/tmp/audio_files`)
- `PROCESSED_FILE`: File to keep track of already processed files (default: `/tmp/processed_files.txt`)
- `PORT`: Port on which the Flask app runs (default: `5009`)

## Project Structure

- `audio_checker.py`: Flask application that handles the audio processing workflow
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build the Docker image

## API Endpoints

### GET /process-audio

- **Description**: Checks for new audio files, processes them, and returns the inference results
- **Response**:
  - `200 OK` with a JSON object containing:
    - `processed_files`: Number of files processed
    - `results`: Array of objects with details about each processed file:
      - `url`: URL of the audio file
      - `status`: Processing status (`success`, `error`, or `skipped`)
      - `inference_result`: Result from the inference service (if successful)
      - `message`: Error or skip reason (if applicable)

## Technologies Used

### Backend:

- **Flask** - Web framework for building APIs with Python
- **Requests** - HTTP library for Python
- **JSON** - Data interchange format
- **Logging** - Python's built-in logging module for application logs

### Others:

- **Docker** - Containerization platform
- **Environment Variables** - For configuration management
